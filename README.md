# Therewolf

## Why the name?

It was named after the famous scene in Young Frankenstein:

```

Inga
  (frightened) Werewolf.
Freddy
  WEREWOLF???
Igor
  There.
Freddy
  What?
Igor
  (pointing to the woods) There wolf.
  (pointing to the road) There castle.
Freddy
  Why are you talking that way?
Igor
  I thought you wanted to.
Freddy
  No, I don't want to.
Igor
  Suit yourself. I'm easy.
